                    <h1>Rise Sunscreen</h1>
                    <p>The problem of young people not protecting themselves from the sun is a serious concern. Despite its importance, many young people are not properly educated on the importance of sun protection, which can lead to negative health outcomes later in life. This lack of education is further compounded by the high cost of sunscreen and its limited accessibility, which can make it difficult for many individuals to protect themselves from the sun's harmful rays.<br><br>

                        To address this issue, we have proposed a school curriculum aimed at educating younger children about the importance of sun protection. By targeting younger children, we aim to instill good habits that will stay with them as they grow into adulthood. Additionally, we are researching and developing a concept company that will produce a universal sunscreen product that is reef-friendly, affordable, and suitable for all skin types and colors. Our goal is to align the product with the school curriculum and make it easier for individuals to use, thereby making sun protection more accessible to everyone.</p>

                            PART ONE focuses on researching the effects of UV exposure in different parts of the world, especially America and Los Angeles. We developed a curriculum for elementary schools in Santa Clarita modeled after the curriculum in Australia. There is a organization called SunSmart in Australia that we took inspiration from and implemented here. The ultimate goal is to carry out this curriculum into various districts in Santa Clarita to start with. We will also create an interactive website that will show our research process as well as the lesson plans.

After all the research was finished, we began to design and create a hypothetical new sunscreen product that emphasizes accessibility and sustainability to everyone. Sunscreen is currently seen as an expensive product, and we want to change that. We aim for this product to be more kid-friendly and fun, so that children will also be more motivated to utilize this sun protection.
